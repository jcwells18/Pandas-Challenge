# Pandas-Challenge
PyCitySchools


This script utilizes pandas and numpy to analyze the district-wide standardized test results of a school district and produce summary tables for analysis.
This analysis includes:

A district summary in table form that includes the district's key metrics:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
  
  
A school summary in table form that summarizes key metrics about each school:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

Tables that highlight the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
  

  Tables that break down math and reading scores by grade:
  * each lists the average Reading Score or Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school
  
  Tables that break down scores by school size and school type:
  * group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large)
  * group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District)


2 observations from the data:
- charter schools perform better than district schools
- medium size schools have the highest overall passing %, but smaller schools have higher average math and reading scores
